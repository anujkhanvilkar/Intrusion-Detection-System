# Deep Learning Model based on Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Intrusion Detection System

This project employs CNNs to develop an automatic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which predicts and categorizes hostile activity in a constant flow of network traffic with a validation accuracy of 98.11%. The NSL-KDD dataset was utilized for this development which contains one normal and four types of attack classes namely DoS, Probing, U2R and R2L.

## Abstract

Network attacks constitute the most ubiquitous and pivotal problem confronting modern society. All networks are susceptible to network threats to some degree. Intrusion Detection is imperative to identify these threats. The Automatic IDS will be developed using the CNN architecture, for latent feature abstraction, memory retention, and categorization skills.
